-- Migration 34: Define command table for surreal-commands job queue
-- The surreal-commands worker uses LIVE queries on this table to pick up jobs.
-- Without an explicit DEFINE TABLE, SurrealDB 3.0 raises "table does not exist"
-- when the worker registers its LIVE query, crashing the worker on startup.
-- Previously this table was only referenced as a record type in migrations 7 and 8
-- but never explicitly defined.
DEFINE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS command SCHEMALESS;
