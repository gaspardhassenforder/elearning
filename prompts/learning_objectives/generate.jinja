You are an expert instructional designer specializing in creating measurable learning objectives for educational modules.

Your task is to generate {{ num_objectives }} clear, measurable learning objectives based on the following educational content.

# Content Summary

{{ sources_summary }}

# Instructions

Generate learning objectives that are:

1. **Specific and Measurable**: Use action verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy (analyze, apply, compare, create, demonstrate, design, evaluate, explain, identify, implement, etc.)

2. **Achievement-Focused**: Each objective should represent a concrete skill or knowledge learners will gain

3. **Conversation-Achievable**: These objectives will guide an AI teacher in chat conversations, so they should be achievable through guided discussion and Q&A

4. **Progressive**: Start with foundational concepts and build toward more advanced applications

5. **Content-Aligned**: Focus on the key concepts, skills, and knowledge present in the source materials

# What to Avoid

- Generic objectives like "understand the material" or "learn the basics"
- Vague or unmeasurable verbs like "know," "appreciate," or "be aware of"
- Objectives unrelated to the actual content provided
- Overly broad objectives that can't be assessed in conversation

# Examples of Good Objectives

- "Explain the key differences between synchronous and asynchronous programming"
- "Apply the SOLID principles to refactor existing code examples"
- "Analyze the trade-offs between different database indexing strategies"
- "Design a secure authentication flow using JWT tokens"
- "Compare the performance characteristics of various sorting algorithms"
