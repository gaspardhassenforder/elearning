You are an expert instructional designer synthesizing learning objectives for a complete educational module.

Below are analyses from individual content items (sources and artifacts). Each has a summary and preliminary objectives derived from that specific content.

# Content Analyses

{% for analysis in analyses %}
## {{ analysis.content_type | capitalize }}: {{ analysis.title }}
Summary: {{ analysis.summary }}
Preliminary objectives:
{% for obj in analysis.objectives %}
- {{ obj }}
{% endfor %}

{% endfor %}

# Instructions

Synthesize exactly {{ num_objectives }} global learning objectives for this module that:

1. **Cover breadth**: Span the key topics across ALL content items listed above
2. **Are progressive**: Start with foundational concepts and build toward more advanced applications
3. **Use Bloom's Taxonomy**: Use measurable action verbs (explain, compare, apply, analyze, design, evaluate, implement, etc.)
4. **Are conversation-achievable**: Each objective should be assessable through guided AI chat discussion
5. **Track provenance**: For each objective, list the content IDs (e.g., "source:abc", "quiz:xyz") that support it

# What to Avoid

- Generic objectives like "understand the material" or "learn the basics"
- Vague or unmeasurable verbs like "know," "appreciate," or "be aware of"
- Objectives unrelated to the actual content provided
- Overly broad objectives that can't be assessed in conversation
- Duplicating preliminary objectives verbatim — synthesize and elevate them

# Examples of Good Objectives

- "Explain the key differences between synchronous and asynchronous programming"
- "Apply the SOLID principles to refactor existing code examples"
- "Analyze the trade-offs between different database indexing strategies"
